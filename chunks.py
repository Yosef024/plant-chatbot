    """Apple Scab 
Overview 
Venturia inaequalis is an ascomycete fungus that overwinters in infected leaf litter as 
pseudothecia, releasing primary ascospores in spring to initiate disease in apple orchards 
worldwide plantclinic.cornell.eduPenn State Extension. 
Symptoms 
• Leaf: Initial olive-green lesions on the upper surface darken to olive-brown and 
develop a velvety covering of conidia, often leading to premature defoliation CALS. 
• Fruit: Small corky, scab‐like spots expand and may crack or deform the fruit, 
reducing marketability and providing entry points for secondary pathogens 
Wikipedia. 
Disease Cycle & Epidemiology 
• Primary infection: Ascospores are discharged from overwintering pseudothecia 
when temperatures are 42–75 °F and leaves remain wet for 6–23 hours 
CALSWikipedia. 
• Secondary cycles: Conidia produced on lesions drive successive infections every 
1–2 weeks throughout the growing season, with risk highest during periods of cool, 
wet weather Penn State Extension. 
Management 
• Sanitation: Removal or incorporation of fallen leaves reduces the primary inoculum 
reservoir CALSCU Blog Service. 
• Resistant cultivars: Cultivars carrying the Vf (Rvi6) resistance gene or other scab‐
resistant varieties reduce reliance on fungicides.

    """Symptoms 
• Roots: Off-white internal decay progressing to black, club-shaped stromata on 
lower roots and trunk base. 
• Canopy: Thinning foliage, general vigor decline, and trees leaning or breaking near 
the soil line over several years apples.extension.org. 
Management 
• Site avoidance: Because the fungus can persist on root debris for up to 15 years, 
sites with a history of black root rot are unsuitable for replanting apples 
apples.extension.org. 
• Soil sanitation: Deep plowing to remove infected root fragments and leaving the 
site fallow can lower inoculum levels before replanting.
